key differences between tuples and lists:

Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means their elements cannot be modified, added, or removed after creation. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable.

Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses () or without any delimiters, with items separated by commas. Lists are defined using square brackets [].

Use Cases: Tuples are typically used to group related data together, where the order and immutability of the elements are important. Lists are used when you need a collection that can be modified over time.
